# WebSafely Scam Checker


WebSafely Scam Checker is a Chrome extension that automatically checks scam scores for websites you visit. The extension fetches the scam score from [websafely.net](https://websafely.net ) and displays it as a badge on the extension icon, helping you stay safe while browsing the web. If a website is not present in our database, it will be added to the scan queue.
